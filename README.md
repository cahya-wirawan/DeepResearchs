# DeepResearchs
A compilation of existing Deep Research repositories

## Open Source

### DeerFlow
DeerFlow (Deep Exploration and Efficient Research Flow) is a community-driven Deep Research framework 
that builds upon the incredible work of the open source community. The goal is to combine language 
models with specialized tools for tasks like web search, crawling, and Python code execution, while 
giving back to the community that made this possible.

### Open Deep Research
An open source deep research clone. AI Agent that reasons large amounts of web data extracted with Firecrawl

### Open Deep Research
An AI-powered research assistant that performs iterative, deep research on any topic by combining search engines, 
web scraping, and large language models. The goal of this repo is to provide the simplest implementation of a 
deep research agent - e.g. an agent that can refine its research direction overtime and deep dive into a topic.

### Open Notebook
An Open Source implementation of Notebook LM with more flexibility and features

### Jina DeepResearch
Keep searching, reading webpages, reasoning until it finds the answer (or exceeding the token budget)

### Gemini Fullstack LangGraph
This project demonstrates a fullstack application using a React frontend and a LangGraph-powered 
backend agent. The agent is designed to perform comprehensive research on a user's query by
dynamically generating search terms, querying the web using Google Search, reflecting on the 
results to identify knowledge gaps, and iteratively refining its search until it can provide 
a well-supported answer with citations.

### Local Deep Researcher
Local Deep Researcher is a fully local web research assistant that uses any LLM hosted by Ollama 
or LMStudio. Give it a topic and it will generate a web search query, gather web search results, 
summarize the results of web search, reflect on the summary to examine knowledge gaps, generate 
a new search query to address the gaps, and repeat for a user-defined number of cycles. 
It will provide the user a final markdown summary with all sources used to generate the summary.
